  RSS
    An XML-based format for syndicating news and other content.

  Location
    The "folder" name where a :term:`Granicus Item` is stored.
    In the Granicus dashboard under the "Archives" tab, this matches
    the "Archive Folders" on the left side.

    This nomenclature was not chosen by the author, but is the term used by the
    Granicus platform.

  Category
    The name of a board or committee that a :term:`Legistar Item` belongs to.
    In Legistar's Calendar view, this is the "Department" filter.

    This nomenclature was chosen since Legistar items are parsed from :term:`RSS`
    feeds and use the embedded ``<category>`` tag.
